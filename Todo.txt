General outline:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        Load config file
            - Control port info for all instances

        Identify/confirm that all instances are UP/Running

        Get Descriptor from cache for each instances(worker thread for each instance)

        Calculate mix-descriptor-batch

        publish descriptors
        
        Check to see which where successfull(Why might they fail?)





Main Loop:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Should monitor instances, and watch for any events that indicate that a descrptor might be reloaded:

        Event trigger 

        Wait for hsdirs to recive new descriptors 

        grab new discriptor for the instance that caused the event cache it

        calculate new mix-desc-batch

        publish

        check for failures 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Events

Tor restarted/UP/DOWN
Descriptor being constructed/published

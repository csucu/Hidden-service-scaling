# Tor - Hidden Service Scaling

This project is concerning my masters thesis which looked at possible techniques which could be used in scaling Torâ€™s hidden
services horizontally, more precisely looking at possible load balancing techniques and hidden service resiliency. A blog 
post summarizing the thesis can be found <a href="https://www.benthamsgaze.org/2015/11/17/scaling-tor-hidden-services/">here</a>,
and you can find the thesis [here](Ceysun%20Sucu%20-%20Hidden%20Service%20Scaling.pdf).

I will be adding proof of concept scripts and some of the experiments done in shadow shortly.

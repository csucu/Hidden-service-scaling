# Tor - Hidden service Scaling

This project is concerning my masters thesis which looked at possible techniques which could be used in scaling Torâ€™s hidden
services horizontally, more precisely looking at possible load balancing techniques and hidden service resiliency. A blog 
post summarizing the thesis can be found <a href="https://www.benthamsgaze.org/2015/11/17/scaling-tor-hidden-services/#more-525">here</a>,
and you can find the thesis it self [here](Hidden-service-scaling/blob/master/Ceysun%20Sucu%20-%20Hidden%20Service%20Scaling.pdf).
